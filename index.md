Hello! I'm a Data Engineer with a passion for building robust data pipelines and extracting insights. Here's a look at my recent work and how I'd love to find ways to contribute:

-   **Air Quality Analysis Project:** I developed a data engineering project focused on analyzing and visualizing air quality trends. You can check out the details [here](https://haloeddepth.github.io/2024/02/25/AQ_project/).
    
-   **Open Source Community:** I'm the founder of open-source [Community](https://projecthuda.github.io/) and always eager to collaborate on meaningful data-driven projects.
    

**Let's Connect!** If you have any open-source projects, datasets, or challenges you'd like to discuss, I'd be thrilled to connect.

Additionally you can check my [Data Engineering Certificate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damjanbabic/overlay/1707397021358/single-media-viewer/?type=DOCUMENT&profileId=ACoAAEfaai4BtpPdZs4MXyoL6ImNB2Xu4KfqvbQ)
