Hello from Croatia! I'm Damjan Babic, a 30-year-old with a fervent interest in technology and diverse cultures. Currently, I'm embarking on a life-changing journey towards establishing a career in Saudi Arabia, an aspiration born out of my profound experience in Jordan, where the intricate tapestry of Arabic culture captivated my heart and mind.

### The Spark of a Dream

The journey began in an unexpected manner. A family trip to Jordan was more than a vacation; it was the genesis of a new chapter in my life. Experiencing the rich culture, historic beauty, and genuine warmth of the people in Jordan opened my eyes to the possibilities that lay in the heart of the Arabic world. The vibrant life and historic allure of the region deeply impressed me, leading me to the decision of pursuing career opportunities in Saudi Arabia. My interest specifically lies in contributing to the groundbreaking Neom project, a symbol of innovation and progress.

### Professional Foundations

In my career, I've always sought roles that challenged and allowed me to grow. My time as an office administrator, particularly at an NGO where I managed several EU projects, has given me a robust foundation in organizational and managerial tasks. These experiences have been invaluable, teaching me the importance of adaptability and proactive problem-solving.

Beyond administrative skills, my passion for technology has been a driving force. I have always found ways to incorporate programming into my professional life, focusing on creating more efficient, automated processes. This blend of administration and innovative tech solutions has defined my professional identity and set the stage for my future endeavors.

### Decentralised Open-Source Community and Showcasing Expertise

Recognizing the importance of a strong technical portfolio, I founded the Huda Community. This open-source initiative serves as a platform to demonstrate my skills in data analysis and software development, crucial areas in today's tech-driven world. Through this community, I aim to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate on projects, and showcase my capabilities to potential employers in Saudi Arabia.

### A Dual Approach: Freelancing and Social Media

Understanding the need for a sustainable income during this transition, I have ventured into freelance marketing. This role not only provides financial stability but also allows me to refine and expand my marketing skills, an essential tool in todayâ€™s digital landscape. Concurrently, I am committed to maintaining an active presence on social media. By sharing my journey, experiences, and insights, I aim to build a narrative that resonates with others and amplifies my professional visibility.

### Embracing the Language and Culture

A crucial part of my preparation is immersing myself in the Arabic language and culture. Proficiency in the local language and understanding cultural nuances are vital for thriving in a new environment. This dedication to cultural adaptation is not just about enhancing job prospects; it's about respecting and valuing the rich traditions and customs of the Arabic world.

Networking is another vital aspect of my strategy. Building connections with natives and expatriates in Saudi Arabia is crucial for gaining insights into the local job market and discovering potential opportunities.
