-   **Long Form Videos:** These will be in a 16:9 ratio, ideal for detailed and comprehensive content.
-   **Short Form Videos (Reels):** Created in a 9:16 ratio, these are perfect for quick, engaging content.

**Two-Part Video Structure**

Each video will consist of two distinct segments:

-   **Personal Recording:** I will record myself in a 1:1 ratio. This part of the video will feature me speaking directly to the audience.
-   **Screen Recording:** The other segment will involve recording a screen to demonstrate or explain what I'm discussing.
    -   For reels, the screen recording will be in a 7:9 ratio.
    -   For long form videos, it will be in a 9:7 ratio.

**Efficient Video Assembly**

-   **Python Scripting:** To streamline the process, I will write a Python script that automatically assembles these two parts into a cohesive video.

**Subtitle Utilization**

-   **YouTube's Auto-Subtitles:** To enhance accessibility and viewer comprehension, I will utilize YouTube's automatic subtitle generation for all my videos.
