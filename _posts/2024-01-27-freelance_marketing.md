**Targeting Local Businesses Lacking Social Media Presence**

In my quest to offer freelance marketing services, my first step is to conduct thorough research on local businesses. Specifically, I am focusing on those that have yet to establish a presence on social media platforms. By identifying these businesses, I can pinpoint where my services are needed the most.

**Strategy for Outreach**

-   **Sorting Businesses:** After compiling a list, I will organize these businesses based on their proximity, starting from the nearest to the furthest.
-   **Personalized Visits:** I plan to visit these businesses in person. This approach allows for a direct and personal interaction, making it easier to understand their unique needs and challenges.
-   **Pitching My Plan:** My pitch to these businesses will be based on my [Content Plan](https://haloeddepth.github.io/system/2024/01/27/content_plan/), with minor adjustments tailored to each business's specific context.
-   **Special Requests:** During my visits, I will inquire about any specific needs or special requests they might have, ensuring that my services are as relevant and effective as possible.

**Pricing Strategy**

-   **Competitive Pricing:** I will offer my services at the same price as the minimum price currently prevalent in my region. This approach ensures competitiveness and accessibility for businesses of all sizes.
