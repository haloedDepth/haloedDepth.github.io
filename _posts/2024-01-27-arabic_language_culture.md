#### My Learning Strategy

**Language Learning with Duolingo**

-   **Daily Commitment:** I have committed to spending at least 30 minutes each day on Duolingo to learn Arabic.
-   **Starting Point:** My focus will initially be on mastering all the letters of the Arabic alphabet.
-   **Progressive Learning:** Post learning the letters, I will devise a plan to understand and use the language effectively.

**Cultural Exploration with MuslimPro**

-   **Cultural Immersion:** To complement my language learning, I will spend 15 minutes daily on the MuslimPro app, enhancing my understanding of Arabic culture.

**Progress Tracker:**

Here are the Arabic symbols for the letters I've learned so far:

-   ii (ي)
-   aa (ا)
-   uu (و)
-   dh (ذ)
-   d (د)
-   k (ك)
-   j (ج)
-   b (ب)
