**Creating Tomorrow's Plan Today**

Every evening, I set aside time to prepare my To-Do list for the next day. This practice not only helps me stay organized but also ensures that I am ready to tackle the day ahead with clear focus and direction.

**Incorporating the To-Do List in Daily Recaps**

At the end of each day, I include my To-Do list in my daily recap reel. This not only helps me keep track of my progress but also holds me accountable to my tasks and goals.

**Prioritizing the To-Do List**

During my day, my top priority is to complete all the items on my To-Do list. This commitment helps me stay disciplined and focused, ensuring that I don't deviate from my planned tasks before they are fully accomplished.

**Accessibility and Transparency**

To maintain transparency and allow others to see how I manage my tasks, I post my To-Do list on my personal website as soon as I create it. This not only keeps me committed but also allows me to share my journey and methods with others.

**Comprehensive Approach**

My To-Do list encompasses everything that I have covered in my approach from the introductory video.
